# Implementation algorithm
Used Dutch Flag Algo:
Similar to Quick Sort to locate the value  within unsorted array
Keeping track of first and last index with maintaining current pointer.

# Run Time Complexity :
Single traversal thus complexity is O(n) <br>
# Space Complexity: 
In place comparison and swapping is done. Since, no additional space is used, hence, space complexity O(n)
