# Implementation logic 
Used Merge Sort to traverse the list by sorting it in descending order<br>
# Time Complexity : 
Mergesort always divides the array into two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves.<br>
Thus , time complexity is of O(nlogn) <br>

# Space Complexity: 
Merge Sort use in-place value comparison and swapping. It is of constant space complexity.
So, the construction of 2 values take a portion of the space of the input array size.<br>
Hence, the construction of the 2 values was done by a single traversal of array, which grows linearly as the size of input.<br>
The overall space complexity is of O(n).
