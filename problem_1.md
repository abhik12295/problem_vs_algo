# Logic Implemented:
Binary Search Algorithm being used to locate the square root value.
The reason is that by adopting Binary Search, in each iteration, <br>
the middle value was calculated and it's square value is compared against the target value.<br>
So in each iteration, half of the values can be eliminated from the search and the efficiency can be greatly increased<br>

# Time Complexity is same as Binary Search O(logn)<br>
# Space Complexity is O(1), since constant space is used in place of input values
